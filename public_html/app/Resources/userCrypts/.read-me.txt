This subfolder will contain all user related encryption IV's and encryption keys for all their respective database tables and fields
Encryption is used to store a user's sensitive data. We at Mafiasource like overkill security and thats why every single user has it's own set of keys.
After every 'encrypted data' change for example setting a new email (sensitive) their iv and key for that field will be regenerated overwritting it's original.
Please respect usage for readability and clarity

Usage USERID / DBTABLE / DBFIELD / (iv | key) . TXT - samples:
  USERID/user/email/iv.txt | Stores the encryption iv for a user with id USERID in the database table `user` field `email`
  USERID/user/email/key.txt | Store the encryption key for a user with id USERID in the database table `user` field `email`
Content samples:
  iv.txt: )Ý«µî¬Ê]mæû´Å
  key.txt: >·5Ü'.„>™¾ÌÆ÷ß5"

masterCrypts:
Working with encrypted values that also need to be checkable in PHP code? For example email exists?
Than use security's masterEncrypt / masterDecrypt, this will use static secret keys so the encrypted output stays the same for the same input.
This makes checking exsitance efficiently, otherwise we whould need to loop over all users and their keys to compare their encrypted data.
Yes masterEncrypt / decrypt is therefore less secure but still better than no encryption at all.
Using master encrypt & decrypt it's advised to store encryptions on the local filesystem rather than in our DB. (example at UserDAO->checkEmail())

TO DO Change structure to ie. /change_email/new_mail.txt serialized by key UserID with array value of 'key' => key, 'iv' => iv

DISCLAIMER
Mafiasource 3 custom encryption is NOT done by cryptographic professionals.
