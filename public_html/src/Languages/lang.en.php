You get $ 1,000,000 if someone signs up through your link. <s>You also get $ 1,000,000 if a referral buys 100 credits from you. You will receive $ 500,000 if a referral of your referral buys 100 credits. Finally, you get $ 250,000 if a referral from the referral of your referral buys 100 credits. (See example).<br /><br />Player A achieves a referral called Player B and receives a one-time $ 1,000,000.<br />Player B buys 100 credits. Player A receives $ 1,000,000.<br /><br />Player B gets three referrals: players C, D and E.<br />Player C buys 100 credits. Player D buys 500 credits and player E buys 200 credits.<br />Player B now receives $ 8,000,000 (after all, 100 credits are bought 8 times).<br />Player A now receives $ 4,000,000 (because he has Player B as a referral).<br /><br />Players C, D and E get 8 referrals together. These 8 referrals together buy 1700 credits.<br />Players C, D and E will receive a total of $ 17,000,000.<br />Player B now receives $ 8,500,000 and Player A receives $ 4,250,000.<br /><br />So if you have a lot of referrals you can make a lot of money. This will be much, much more if your referrals also have referrals, and the referrals thereof!</s>",
